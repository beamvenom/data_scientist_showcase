# data_scientist_showcase (SAMPLE)

The project was to categorize different jobs and fit consultants to those job posts. 
This is to make it easier for sellers to know which consultants to send when the job post is vague or has different meanings. 
For example, Data scientist has many different definitions from company to company, and also country to country.
- Web scraped different job websites.
- Pruned the data for Natural Language Processing.
- Optimized NLP with machine learning to fit desired output.
