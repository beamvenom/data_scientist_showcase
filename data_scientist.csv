JOB68800338915,Data Scientist,Data Scientist,,,"Analysis of Interactome and Protein Turnover Dynamics Regulating Antiviral Immunity
The pathogenic activity of viruses is to a large extent based on their ability to modulate protein activities in infected cells. In the course of an European Research Council (ERC)-funded (5 years perspective) project (ProDAP) we will study the influence of viruses on the host proteome.
We use state-of-the-art mass spectrometry (MS) and deep sequencing techniques to obtain large-scale data and study how viruses and other pathogens transform the landscape of protein interactions. This data is critical to understand how our organism deals with infecting pathogens. To analyze the MS data we have developed comprehensive bioinformatic pipelines combining the leading approaches for Bayesian statistical modeling, biological data processing and visualization (R, Julia, Stan, Plotly, Sun Grid Engine). Follow up evaluation using phenotypic screens based on an automated live-microscopy platform allow functional interpretation of the analysed data. These data will be considered for systems analysis of virus infections.
Your ultimate mission will be to use the power of bioinformatics to study host-pathogen interactions on a systems level. You are expected to further develop the bioinformatic framework and collaborate with other scientists to generate tools that will be used to analyze primary data. The ultimate aim is to identify novel regulatory mechanisms that are used by the immune system, explain how infection with pathogens cause disease and potentially pinpoint druggable hotspots in the antiviral protein-protein interaction network.
The strength of our lab is the synergy between wet-lab work and data analysis. At each stage of the project you will be working in a close collaboration with wet-lab scientists: from the initial experiment design to the hypothesis validation. Your creativity and critical input will be a key driver in these projects.

JOB86408305651,Data Scientist,Data Scientist,,,"The opportunity An exciting opportunity has arisen for a Data Scientist to join the Cancer Research UK Grand Challenge Project ‘Mutographs’ on a Fixed Term Contract until May 2022 (with the possibility of extension). We are looking for a new team member to help us analyse cancer genomes collected from around the world in this ambitious and high profile project.
Mutographs is a large, international, multidisciplinary project, led by Professor Mike Stratton. The project was funded in 2017 in the first round of Cancer Research UK Grand Challenge projects. The project aims to explain major global differences in cancer incidence, through analysis of cancer samples from 5,000 patients, covering 5 different types of cancer, and collected across 5 continents.
We are approximately half way through this project and are looking for someone to join the team to help us analyse cancer DNA sequence data from Work Package 1 by ‘chaperoning’ data through an existing data analysis pipeline. This role is computer-based and full training by existing team members will be provided.
You will work remotely at least for the remainder of 2020 and likely beyond, depending on Government guidelines. You will be welcomed into a team that has been successfully working from home since March 2020, we have experience with on-boarding people remotely and have regular formal and informal meetings to ensure all members of the team continue to feel engaged and motivated in this exciting project. You will work closely with the Mutographs scientists, bioinformaticians and project manager and informally with a wider team from the Cancer, Ageing and Somatic Mutation Programme at the Sanger Institute.
About you The position would suit a graduate (or equivalent experience) who is interested in genomics and/or cancer biology, wishes to learn or develop their skills in analysing NGS sequencing data and who enjoys responsibility for their own area of work, but within the nurturing environment of a strong team.
We are looking for a team player and effective communicator who works well with others and can also work independently (once trained) to a high level of detail and diligence.

Area of research:
Part-Time Suitability:
The position is suitable for part-time employment.
Job description:
Since rocket engines operate at the limits of what is technically feasible, they are inherently susceptible to a wide variety of different faults. The immense costs associated with the loss of the launch vehicle or a test bench clearly show the importance of a suitable FDI system. Such system has to provide a proper diagnosis in real-time from existing sensor data to detect and classify abnormal behavior and, for example, to trigger an emergency shutdown.
While efforts are underway to develop model-based FDI strategies, there are cases where the exact theoretical modeling is not possible or would be very costly. A potentially promising way forward that is addressed in this thesis is to apply machine learning and especially deep learning algorithms to assist and, in some places, even replace model-based techniques. The application is challenging because the number of training data is very limited and one is practically always in the “small data regime”. In addition, the measured values are noisy to varying degrees and belong to different modalities.
During your PhD you will work on the following research and development tasks, among others:
development and implementation of an FDI framework for liquid propellant rocket engines by the integration of machine learning with modern signal processing methods
performing of system simulations using EcosimPro to evaluate the framework and generate synthetic training data
The infrastructure at the DLR Institute of Space Propulsion will also provide the opportunity to validate and further develop a promising FDI system through real hot fire tests of demonstrator engines.

The Sanger Institute with other partners has launched the Darwin Tree of Life project to provide high quality genome assemblies for all eukaryotic species in the British Isles. This project will significantly contribute to the global Earth Biogenome Project, fundamentally changing scientific knowledge of evolution and interactions among millions of the planet’s organisms.
We are seeking two talented bioinformaticians or genomics data scientists to contribute to genome assembly, data analysis and the development of methods and software to support the Darwin Tree of Life project. Sequencing technologies are constantly evolving in terms of the type and volume of the sequence data they produce. The recent progress in long-read sequencing technologies means that we are now beginning to be able to consistently deliver high quality genome assemblies for species that did not previously have such a resource. There are opportunities and challenges to design scalable and robust informatics solutions for the data tracking, storage, and analysis of this data. One of the most challenging aspects of this role will be to produce high-quality scientific results on a large scale while adapting to rapid developments in sequencing technology and software.
The primary responsibilities of the successful applicants will be:
• To develop, maintain, and run pipelines and processes for the processing, QC, and analysis of high-throughput sequencing data.
• To evaluate and compare new tools and technologies such as new assembly programs or tools for inclusion in the pipeline.
• To develop and maintain a system for tracking data sets and their analysis progress against team projects.
• To participate in the development of novel bioinformatics software tools and techniques for high-throughput sequencing and assembly.
• To contribute to scientific publications.
• To help to make our data and resources available to a large community of biologists and geneticists.
These roles would suit somebody with some previous experience with bioinformatics or other large scale scientific data analysis, or a newly qualified graduate student with data science skills interested in DNA sequence data. While desirable, previous experience with DNA sequencing data is not strictly necessary for the position. We have a strong publication record and culture of producing open data resources and open source software development. This role requires an investigative and solution-oriented mind set and excellent communication skills to work effectively within large national and international consortia.

The REsolution consortium
Starting on June 1st of 2021, the REsolution consortium is supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI, www.imi.europa.eu) and consists of 9 partners from academia and the pharmaceutical industry. The consortium is coordinated by the Superti-Furga laboratory and builds on the successful work of the RESOLUTE consortium, which focuses on the systematic deorphanization of SLCs and is creating open-access tools, high-throughput assays and omics data. While RESOLUTE is focused on basic aspects of SLC biochemistry and biology, REsolution will add a medical genomics dimension. REsolution will assemble human SLC genetic information, annotate the data within the RESOLUTE knowledgebase, study the structure-activity relationship for selected SLC variants, and use deep mutagenesis and artiﬁcial intelligence to develop better models for the interpretation of SLC genetic variation. Contextualization of SLCs in the human medical genetics landscape is an important step towards the establishment of the medically relevant but understudied SLC family as a tractable target class.
The Superti-Furga laboratory
The Superti-Furga group (http://superti-furga-lab.at/) is composed of an international team of more than 30 scientists working together on understanding drug function at the molecular level. The laboratory investigates how cells and biological systems in general manage access to the environment through cellular transport. In particular how access to nutrients and energy source is tuned to metabolism and need of individual cell types. Moreover, the lab has pioneered approaches for functional precision medicine. The laboratory operates on a truly multidisciplinary basis and involves functional genomics and proteomics, structural analysis, chemical biology, high-content imaging, bioinformatics and physiology, reﬂecting the blend of expertise of the laboratory members.

JOB171145799029,Data Scientist,Data Scientist,,,"About us
Spanish for meditative and contemplating, Cogitativo was created with the purpose of thinking deeply about the issues affecting our healthcare system.
WE ARE A DIFFERENT KIND OF DATA SCIENCE COMPANY
We are singularly focused on improving our healthcare system for all stakeholders – especially patients - by helping our clients make sense of complex data so they can answer their most challenging questions. Educated at some of the world’s top academic institutions, our data scientists use advanced analytical and machine learning methods. These methods provide our clients an unbiased, scientific view into their operational performance. This enables our clients to identify and reduce costly, undetected failures in their operational processes and business systems. Our principles are simple: have a passion for healthcare, nothing is permanent and always challenge the status quo. We also believe that our distinctive capabilities shouldn’t perpetuate the inertial ‘zero sum game’ where success is measured by how much the winners take from the losers. Only in this way we will be able to positively impact the delivery of healthcare while building a successful company.
WHY DO OUR CLIENTS WORK WITH US?
As industry leaders begin to understand that behaviors drive the efficacy of the system, they are coming to realize they don’t have the in-house capabilities needed to identify the underlying attributes of these behaviors. Cogitativo’s ‘data science as a service’ offering is a customized response to the unique questions our clients are struggling to answer. Using a challenge-based learning approach, our data scientists connect our client’s disparate, noisy data and then develop customized solutions that let our clients look deeply into their business.
Just as an MRI is able to see what is happening inside the human body, our ‘data science as a service’ model quickly enables our client’s to solve their most intractable business problems.

Bold Metrics Inc. (BMI) has created a suite of AI technologies that allows brands to accurately predict customer body measurements and relate them to garment specifications. Using our cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, retailers and brands are ditching conventional sizing solutions and leveraging our technology to reduce returns and increase conversions. Ultimately, our goal is to revolutionize the apparel industry by leveraging this data to unlock body-relative apparel design.
Historically, apparel sizes have been generated in the absence of customer-driven body data. This has lead to a worldwide apparel waste problem caused by a high rate of returns coupled with a bad consumer experience around fit and sizing, often amplified online. Along with garment sizing optimizations, the downstream experience becomes more customer-driven, leading to a significant reduction in returns and happier customers.
We are a venture-backed well funded company ($3.77M raised to-date) with year-over-year growth of 350%. Bold Metrics works with some of the world's largest brands, retailers and clothing manufacturers in the US, Europe and Asia, and has offices in Austin, TX and San Francisco, CA.

We develop and use ground-breaking data technologies and data science algorithms to sift through large amounts of data and distill it into information about our customers' wants and needs. We then integrate these insights into our automated decision-making systems to constantly improve our services.
Now we're looking for the next wave of great data scientists to work on presenting just the right deals to the right users at the right time, for hundreds of millions of daily interactions. We work in small, independent, and agile teams, and collaborate with Product Designers to implement stuff quickly. These high-purpose and demanding roles offer a unique combination of computer science, engineering, algorithms and applied math, scalable production systems, consumer product thinking, and business revenue optimization. Personalization for Local+Mobile is uncharted territory in ecommerce, and you can make your mark working on that at Groupon. There are not a lot of boundaries here, so expect to make a huge impact.
We're a ""best of both worlds"" kind of company. We're big enough to have resources and scale, but small enough that a single person has a surprising amount of autonomy and can make a meaningful impact. We're curious, fun, a little intense, and passionate about helping local businesses thrive. Does that sound like a compelling place to work?
What You'll Be Doing:
You will be working with big data, leveraging our cutting-edge tech stack, using techniques like machine learning, optimization, deep neural networks, etc. to solve real business problems. You'll work shoulder-to-shoulder with our engineering and science teams. Your assignment will vary depending on the team you are placed into.
Here are some example projects that previous interns worked on:
Merchant ranking: Determining which merchants to call first based on multiple objectives
User behavior modeling: Predicting user propensity for click, conversion, and attrition
Personalization: Recommendation algorithms for both users and merchants
Forecasting: Modeling historical data to forecast demand, purchase propensity, merchant risk, etc.
Marketing and CRM: Customer life-stage modeling, large-scale advertising on search engines and social media for customer acquisition and continued engagement
Deal portfolio selection: Large-scale linear and nonlinear constrained optimization algorithms for managing the right portfolio of deals in each local market
What to Expect:
Exposure - Being a household name gives employees the opportunity to work in startup-like environment and focus on deeply interesting work that you wouldn’t get to do anywhere else; you will have a large-scale impact in a short amount of time
Professional Development - Participate in weekly “lunch and learns” with other engineering and business functions, skill building workshops, and networking sessions
Fun - Explore the city through our planned intern social outings, and develop your network while getting to know your peers and Groupon’s leaders
Mentorship - Look forward to one-on-one time with dedicated managers and mentors to facilitate your growth throughout the summer internship experience
We’re excited about you if you have:
You should be currently enrolled in a MS or PhD program in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Math, Statistics or related field
Preferred emphasis on algorithms, machine learning, data mining, statistics, applied mathematics, or similar field
You have strong coding skills in one or more programming language, such as Java/C++/Python/Ruby etc.
You have an understanding of applied math topics, such as probability and statistics, linear algebra, basic optimization techniques
Experience in SQL, Hadoop, R and scripting preferred
You are an excellent and efficient communicator
You have a passion for consumer experience, a desire to go into uncharted territory with bold new ideas, and a willingness to go the last mile on execution

We're kind of nerdy… We geek out about new technology. We love music. We're into soccer. We dance through life (sometimes literally). We're foodies. Essentially…we love noodling on new ideas and our love of learning extends beyond our fields of study. And we like to share that.
About you:
Your experience:
8+ years of experience applying advanced AI techniques (machine learning, predictive analytics, optimization, semantic analysis, time-series analysis, advanced visualization) to real-world problems.
You have a demonstrated ability to iteratively conceptualize, design and build data-driven analytical models, and have taken a project leadership role in shaping these solutions.
Strong capabilities in modern analytics languages/tools.
Balancing breadth, you also bring a particular depth in at least one of the following areas: Deep Learning, Optimization or Operations Research, NLP, Image Processing, or Machine Learning. Given the problems we are tackling, there is a place at Noodle for experts in various fields.
You have an advanced degree in a relevant field (Computer Science, Operations Research, Statistics, Applied Math, Electrical Engineering, or other Computational Science)
You have experience manipulating and preparing large, heterogeneous data sets (""Big Data"") to support advanced analytics.
Your working style:
Collaborative, open, and respectful working style
Intellectual curiosity and the hunger and humility to always keep learning… and to share that learning. You enjoy mentoring other intellectually curious data scientists.
Experience with (and excitement for) interdisciplinary collaboration
Demonstrated energy and passion that extends beyond your field of study – Are you a computer scientist who writes poetry? A mathematician who loves psychology? An engineer passionate about public policy? We want to build something with you.
Want to help shape the future of Enterprise Artificial Intelligence?
Let's noodle.

Recently ranked #5 in Forbes Magazine's list of America's Most Promising Companies, Carvana offers the excitement, culture, and opportunity of a start-up, along with the capitalization and infrastructure of an established business.
We sell cars, but we're not salespeople. At Carvana, we've made it our mission to transform how cars are bought and sold. We saw a huge problem with how much it can suck to buy a car the traditional way so we committed to tackling one of the largest, yet-to-be-disrupted markets in the world – the $1T per year U.S. car market (yes, that's $Trillion with a ""T"").
We provide a seamless, online car buying experience for consumers. From our searchable showroom of fully-inspected, certified cars, to high-resolution 360° photographs of our vehicles' interior and exterior, to real-time financing and warranty packages. With delivery possible to the buyer's driveway in 24 hours or pick-up available from one of our state-of-the-art car vending machines (yes, you read that right) all with a 7-day money back guarantee, customer satisfaction is at the core of our business. With no dealerships or commissioned sales people, we also save thousands of dollars per car that we pass on to our customers.
For more information on Carvana, take a look at our company introduction video. ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dpBRp0-_w )

In return for your hard work, you'll have an opportunity to work at one of the fastest growing and creative technology companies around, as well as help us promote a life-changing product and develop a world-class team every day.
In our down time we have ping pong and corn hole (or ""bags,"" depending on where you're from) tournaments. However, the pace is pretty quick around here, so you'll need to be prepared to keep up.
We also have Wacky Pants Wednesdays…so you'll have to come correct here to compete with our CEO Ernie.

Zume is on a quest to be the most powerful source of health and well-being on the planet. To achieve our objective, we must facilitate the provision of wholesome, affordable food on a global scale and in a sustainable manner. We are meeting this challenge by providing an end-to-end, scalable platform that reduces the time and distance between clean food sources and dense population centers, using cutting-edge automation and transportation logistics. By developing better tools and processes, we can feed people healthier, sustainably-grown food, delivered fresh and free from chemical stabilization.
THE ROLE
We're expanding our fleet of vehicles that can autonomously prepare food in-transit. We've proven that we can do it with Pizza now we're going to scale it to all prepared food.

Experience with hardware a plus, but not required.
This is a rare opportunity to get in at the early stages of a growing team, in a rapidly growing company. We're looking for one of the next leaders in the industry. If that's you, lets talk.
WHO YOU ARE

We’re NT Concepts, a leading provider of business and technology solutions for the intelligence and national security communities! Our team of engineers, subject matter experts, and data scientists provide experienced, high-quality Information Technology (IT) and cybersecurity engineering and innovation support. We do that by working with some complex clients on their hardest challenges. Clients with massive, complex data sets. So we get to keep learning, building, and keeping our skills sharp. And since life’s too short to spend with difficult people, we hire team members that not only like to solve problems, but that we like so hang out with. That's important.
Responsibilities
And… Why We’re Both Here - This “Job” Thing
Here it is: we have some opportunities. And we’d like to get to know some more amazing people, that might want to talk about that. People like you. Since you’re reading this, and the title’s “data scientist,” we’re thinking you might be a little interested. Very cool.
We love people who dream big, find data fascinating, and understand that’s it’s not just about data: it’s about the science behind it, and how you can use it to solve real-world problems. We've got some tricky time-series data on this particular project and are looking for creative minds in the deep learning space to tackle it. (Also, if you happen to have some level of talent at, say kick-ball or giant Jenga: bonus points).
Qualifications
Okay, beyond the basics (you solve problems, and are generally nice), we’re looking for a few skills. Less concerned with the specific technologies (great scientists can learn new tech as it emerges), more about horsepower.. That said, here are a couple bullets, things we look for:
Data science is a dynamic and evolving profession – we’re looking for people who love to learn and find unique solutions without being micro-managed: you’ll have the freedom to try new things, test solutions and technologies, and tell us when there’s a better path.
You know your way around a cloud console and have handled some pretty large volumes of data (time-series a plus!).
You are familiar with a few machine learning frameworks, like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
You've got experience with deep learning.
Maybe you have used enterprise products in the past for high throughput data ingestion and analysis.
Ultimately, we need someone who knows their way around data modeling, information extraction, time-series forecasting, machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis, or applied mathematics.
We realize that data scientists are a diverse breed and we are excited to hear how your unique combination of skills might apply to our current problem sets

At Shift Technology we are proud to have a purpose: to help insurers weed out claims corruption. Our SaaS solution, which leverages Big Data and AI, has been used to unravel fraud networks across Asia, Europe, and the Americas.
If you are someone motivated by meaningful work, Shift Technology may just be the spot for you!
Your day-to-day
At Shift Technology, we are constantly looking for new ways to innovate. Fraud landscapes are in constant motion and in order to ensure our detection methods are always one step ahead, our data scientists must be too.
Shift Technology data scientists are the central productive force of the company. They design the models, construct the features, implement the rules, and optimize the algorithms that are used throughout the data processing pipeline. They face two main challenges: messy and often incomplete data paired with complex and ever-evolving problems.
The data we collect comes in all shapes and sizes and is not, for the most part, quantitative. Insurance claims data typically includes date, location, circumstantial details, damage descriptions, and involved parties. With that wide array of information, our data scientists must be comfortable with a variety of specific approaches: unsupervised anomaly detection, temporal sequences analysis, semantic network analysis …
As for the solution, our data scientists must be able to produce predictions justified with intelligible explanations, even when very little data is available.
Our data scientists have the exciting mission of designing and implementing models that replicate and enhance real-world fraud handling deduction patterns. They are tasked with optimizing the algorithms involved in the data processing pipeline and making adjustments as fraud scenarios mature and evolve.
After a few short months of joining our data scientist team you will be able to:
Understand insurance data and fraud mechanisms;
Create the associated mathematical models;
Implement, test and optimize the associated algorithms;
Participate in workshops with the clients to gather feedback and integrate it to the models;
Continuously provide ideas to improve the solution.
Your toolkit
On the job you will be asked to code in C# so programming experience is a big advantage, but not essential if you are willing to learn fast!
Your profile
Shift Technology’s data science department is filled with top performers who are committed to technical excellence, inspired by challenging projects, and always on the look-out for new learning opportunities.
If the following qualities ring true, you would fit right in at Shift Technology:
You have advanced technical skills in Applied Mathematics, preferably in machine learning and/or operations research;
You combine strong analysis with synthesis abilities and are not afraid to deal with the details;
You can write quality production code;
You don't mind meeting with clients to discuss their needs and integrate their feedback in your projects;
You are bilingual in English !

More about WalletHub
WalletHub is a high-growth fintech company based in Washington, DC that is looking for talented, hard-working individuals to help us reshape personal finance. More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we’re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:
1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.
2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.
3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.
In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.
Although we appreciate your interest in working with us, due to the high number of applications we receive, we will only be able to respond to successful applicants.

Founded by Adam Pisoni, the co-founder and former CTO of Yammer, Abl ( https://ablschools.com/ ) is an early-stage edtech company developing a data insights platform for K12 principals.
In summer 2017, we launched our first product, a next-generation Master Scheduler that allows school leaders to build student-centric schedules. Master schedules are the pulse of school operations. Current scheduling tools are not designed to help school leaders meet the needs and personal interests of every student.
The Role
We are looking for an experienced Data Scientist, and in this role, you will help schools understand the impact operational changes have on their students and staff. You'll collaborate with a team of product designers, engineers, and school leaders to build software features that help schools overcome complex logistical challenges.
As a Data Scientist at Abl, your work will immediately improve equity in and operations of schools across the country. You will collaborate with product designers to determine what to build and prototype, with engineers to deploy software into production use, and with our schools team to provide decision support for K12 principals who are implementing novel solutions to complex scheduling problems.
Recent data science projects include:
Defining and calculating measures of inequity for students within a school schedule
Building recommendations for course placement in a schedule
Proposing and prototyping algorithms for supporting team teaching best practices
Developing metrics and visualizations for student tracking
The Team
Our product research and development team is small, passionate, and inclusive. You will be the second Data Scientist at Abl and will work across the product and business.
As a data team, our goal is to produce software and insights that are proactive, guiding our peers and school leaders towards the right thing to do next, rather than taking a reactive view or simply describing what has been done. For the current stage of our business, our domain, and our customers, we have found that a bias towards reproducible, and more easily interpretable models and metrics is more useful than attempting to ruthlessly optimize an algorithm.
Responsibilities
Build underlying systems that power our data-driven products (e.g., recommendation engines, constraint solvers, and predictive models)
Consult directly with school leaders to work on complex problems within Abl's product using your research and rapid prototyping skills to push new features into production
Perform data profiling, complex sampling, and statistical modeling
Design and develop tailored data models for K12 schools
Identify incomplete data, improve the quality of data, and integrate data from several data sources
Work on the challenge of combining data from across schools and districts, who all store things differently, so that we can measure our impact in aggregate
Determine how to evaluate equity, or fairness, for students and for teachers
Propose metrics for evaluating the overall quality of a schedule and methods for comparing multiple schedules' ability to meet school leader priorities
Find trends and insights in complex, human-generated school data
Qualifications
Strong programming skills (e.g., Python, R, and/or JavaScript)
Proficiency in writing SQL queries
Ability and desire to present complex findings in a simple, approachable way for non-technical audiences (e.g., in writing, through reporting tools, and at in-person presentations)
Experience with cleaning, structuring, and transforming data via ETL processes
Ability to design and deploy machine learning algorithms and models
Company Culture
Abl employees all share a passion for revolutionizing education through school design, whether or not they have prior experience working in the field. We value the diversity of background and thought. We strive to create a safe and supportive environment where trust, communication, creativity, and humility are valued as highly as technical skills. We believe shared ownership builds a more resilient company, and we tackle hard problems, together. If that sounds like your dream work environment, we look forward to hearing from you.
